Backlog:
============================
- Feature F1 - Add option to "Save to Favorites" for easy retrieval by the user.
				This feature requires an addition to PlotUI which records "favorited" items
				This feature adds a checkbox to MainAndDownloadUI which allows user to "toggle favorites"
- Bug Fix B1 - Main screen should resize with window resize or window resize should be disabled
- Feature F4 - Add columns to the main display for RA, Dec in Hours, Degrees.
- Feature F5 - Make table in main screen configurable (which data to display is user controlled)
- Feature F3 - Add to Plot Options:
				* Label for smoothing + description
				* Add toggle for going to next with current settings selected 
- Bug Fix B2 - Fix main display with standard units added to the labels.
- Feature F2 - Allow a user to "Next" to any spectrum and "Next Match" to the next spectrum with matches
- Bug Fix B3 - Fibers start numbering at 0, so I need to refactor the code which reads 0 as "download all" to be a negative number.
