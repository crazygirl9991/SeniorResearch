Overview
========================================================================
These are the installation instructions for the Tielebein et al. Senior 
Research thesis project and code. 


Prerequisites
========================================================================
Java version 1.6 or later 


Code Repository Location
========================================================================
https://github.com/QuasarSpectralSoftware/Application
Go to the directory where you'd like to place the working version of the 
code. Then do:
	> git init
	> git clone https://github.com/QuasarSpectralSoftware/Application

This should check-out the current working version. The only file
needed to run the application is SpectralAnalysisTool.jar, but
the rest of the source code is needed to edit and recompile.


Running the Application 
========================================================================
To run the software, put the jar in desired directory (creating a new
directory for the software is recommended, as it will create files
and directories as needed for run-time). 

Windows - double-clicking the archive should run it via java by default,
          however, if alternate settings are being used, then you may
          have to select an application with which to run the archive.
          Just select whichever java compiler you have currently installed.
       
Linux  -  You must run the java archive from the command line. cd into the
    	  top level directory and type:
    	  $ java -jar SpectralAnalysisTool.jar
    	  
    	  This should open up the UI.
    	  
MacOS  -  TODO
