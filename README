Overview
========================================================================
This is the top-level README file associated with the Tielebein et al. 
Senior Research thesis project and code. 

The vast majority of this project and code was written by Victoria Tielebein 
under the guidance of Prof. Gordon T. Richards and Dr. Nicholas P. Ross, at
Drexel University during the Academic Year 2013-2014. 


Purpose
========================================================================
To query the SDSS, SDSS-III and potentially future [SDSS-IV] spectroscopic
databases to look for objects (quasars) that have multiple repeat spectra, 
and to see what, if anything, has changed between these spectra when observed
at different epochs.

/cos_pc19a_npr/BOSS/Tori/SeniorResearch/src/downloadCenter

  WorkingDirectory.java
  - Enumerated type designed to locate the Working Directory of this application 
    and keep track of/create any and all subdirectories. 

  Utility.java
  - Contains conversion functions e.g. array to strings, for both arrays and certain
    mathematical procedures. 

  TableElement.java
  - Keeps track of all administrative information of a .FITS file, knowing how to 
    parse from and create strings for outputting to a Table file. 

  TableManager.java
  - 

  CommandExecutor.java
  - Contains the logic to make changes to the user system, e.g. by creating or removing 
    files or directories, or using wget to download files from the SDSS servers.     
    Is the class that does all the commands; gets passed around a lot. 

  DownloadStore.java
  - Abstract class controlling the retrieval and storage of .FITS file information. 
    ("The Class".) 

  PlateInfoDownloadStore.java
  - Concrete class for accessing .FITS file, given Plate information for any object. 
  Inherits from DownloadStore.java
  
  ListDownloadStore.java
  - Concrete class for accessing .FITS file, given a List of URLs for any number 
  of objects. Inherits from DownloadStore.java

  CoordsDownloadStore.java (Currently unimplemented)
  - Concrete class for accessing .FITS file, given coordinate information. 
  Inherits from DownloadStore.java
 
  DownloadCenter.java
  - Main controller for anything download or table related interfaces directly with 
   the command line.
